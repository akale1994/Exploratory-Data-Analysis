# Exploratory Data Analysis - Python
## Global Survey of IT Professionals
<br>

#### In late 2018, a survey was conducted for a large Australian collective of IT professionals. The survey, which received 7000 responses, aimed to gather information about IT professionals. The dataset was made public, and many insights have emerged since. We have taken the data set and heavily modified the data. Both to clean the data, a significant component of data science and to ensure original assignment submission.<br><br>

<i>This was an individual assignment where I scored the highest grade.</i>
